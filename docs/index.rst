ACM @ Miami University
======================

"Who are you?"
--------------

We are a coding organization for novices, beginners, intermediates, experts, and professionals.

"What do you do?"
-----------------

This year, our focus is peer-collaborative programming projects.
We want to bring the fun and social aspect of collaborative work back into computing.
We plan to do this through pratical group projects where everyone can have fun and get to know eachother.



.. Typically, group projects consist of working alone and posting to GitHub (Google Docs, except for code).
.. In our projects, however, we will work together.


"Do I need prior programming experience?"
-----------------------------------------

Nope.  We'll teach you along the way.

If you do have programming experience, or lots of it, great!
We'd love to have you exercise your more advanced skills and impart your knowledge on some others.

"What programming language do you plan to use?"
-----------------------------------------------

Python! It is an interpreted programming language whose syntax is elegant, simple, and most-of-all easy to learn.
